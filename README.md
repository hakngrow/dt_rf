#### Decision Trees

Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning models used for classification and regression. Decision trees learn from data with a set of if-then-else decision rules. Decision trees are one of the most popular algorithms used in machine learning. 

Decision trees are classification or regression models in the form of a tree structure. When training a dataset (for regression or classification), the model divides the data into smaller and smalller datasets based on a certain feature value until the target variables all fall under one category.  The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes. A decision node has two or more branches. Leaf node represents a classification or decision. Decision trees can handle both categorical and numerical data.

Letâ€™s define a simple problem and demostrate how a decision tree model can be used to solve a classification problem.
